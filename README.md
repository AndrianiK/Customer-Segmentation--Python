## Customer Segmentation and Data-Driven Strategy Enhacement

In order to understand the customers of XYZ Sports Company, we are introducing a
comprehensive cluster strategy that encloses three key perspectives: value, demographics, and sports
activities. This multifaceted approach aims to segment the customer base into distinct groups, each
characterized by unique attributes and behaviors.

Our methodology incorporates a series of sophisticated analytical techniques, such as
Principal Component Analysis, the Elbow Method, KMeans clustering and DBSCAN, to name a few.
Our metric to evaluate our clusters was the silhouette score, which measures the quality based on
cohesion and separation within the clusters.
